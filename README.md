This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.


In this project, you are required to do

1. Exploratory Data Analysis

2. Understanding what type content is available in different countries

3. If Netflix has been increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.

4. Clustering similar content by matching text-based features


The purpose of this project is to classify/group Netflix shows into clusters so that shows within a cluster are similar while shows in separate clusters are dissimilar. Use dimensionality reduction techniques to expose hidden patterns. The end result will be deep insights into Netflix's content planning, interactive dashboards for user exploration, and a complete picture of how Netflix material is perceived in the larger entertainment ecosystem.
